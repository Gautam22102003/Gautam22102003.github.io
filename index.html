    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> As a passionate developer, I thrive on turning ideas into reality through code. My journey in software development is driven by an insatiable curiosity and a love for building meaningful solutions that make a difference.
            Every project is an opportunity to learn something new – whether I'm crafting responsive web applications, diving deep into backend architectures, or exploring emerging technologies. I find joy in those moments when complex problems meet elegant solutions, and I'm always eager to push my boundaries to discover what's possible.
            What excites me most about development is the endless potential for innovation and collaboration. I believe the best solutions emerge when we combine different perspectives and skills. That's why I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers, sharing knowledge, and working on challenging projects together.
            Beyond writing code, I'm committed to continuous growth and staying current with industry trends. When I'm not working on projects, you'll find me experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source initiatives, or helping other developers overcome technical challenges.
            I'm currently looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects that challenge me to grow while making a meaningful impact. Let's build something amazing together!.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Kaggle-Future-Predicting-Sales</h3>
            <p>Sales prediction using Kaggle algorithms involves building machine learning models to forecast future sales based on historical data. By utilizing algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks, the model learns from past sales patterns to predict future performance, aiding in business decisions.</p>
